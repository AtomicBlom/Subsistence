Definition: maintaining or supporting oneself at a minimum level. That's what this mod does.

Subsistence started as EDX: Skyblock, which was based off of tier 1 mechanics in the Electrodynamics mod. We discovered that these blocks and tools alone would function well as a skyblock utility so we isolated it, added a crap-ton of customizable JSON configs, and tweaked a few things. Since this mod had nothing to do with the science of electrodynamics anymore, I felt a name change was in order. Thus, Subsistence.
